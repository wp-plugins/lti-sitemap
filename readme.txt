Hassle free XML Sitemaps: pick your featured content, let search engines do the rest!

== Description ==

Search engines will only feature content in search results if they can reach and peruse content. Having a sitemap at the root of your website makes it easier for specialized programs such as [search engine bots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler) to find that content.

LTI Sitemap will generate a set of sitemaps that robots can easily crawl through (it's a simple set of links, packaged into XML), as well as make the sitemap human-readable by separating post types and allowing you to select the types of content to feature.

It integrates with Google Search console, allowing you to manage the main sitemap from Wordpress.

= Available languages =

 - English
 - Fran√ßais

= Mapping your content =

The following information can be mapped, if the corresponding option is activated:

- Front page and personalized pages,
- Posts,
 - With no categorization,
 - Categorization by year,
 - Categorization by month and year,
- Pages,
- Authors,
- Images in posts,
- News

LTI Sitemap can generate Google news sitemaps which allow Google to keep track of your most recent news items.

A postbox is added to the post editor to specify whether a post is classified as news. Optional news fields can be filled:
- Title,
- Keywords,
- Access (full, subscription, registration)
- Genre (press release, satire, blog, op ed, opinion, user generated)
- Stick tickers

= Taking advantage of the Google Search Console =

We want to make sure Wordpress users know about the Search console by facilitating the process of managing the main sitemap directly from Wordpress. Without these types of tools, it would be hard to assess whether our SEO efforts are worth putting time and effort into!

= Why sitemaps? =

Other than facilitating the indexing of your site, sitemaps offer an easy way to detect potential issues having to do with crawling on your site. Using Google or Bing webmaster tools, you can identify which sets of pages encountered problems and correct potential issues more quickly.
